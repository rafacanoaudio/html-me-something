                <p class="myClass">We all have appliances at home. They mostly live in the kitchen.
                    I want to share with you the ones I use most often. I own a couple more that are only used a handfule of times a year.
                    I still enjoy them, and I would recommend any cook to give them a try sometime.
                    Can you guess what they are?
                    They are a bread maker, a slow cooker,and an immersion sous-vide.
                    I will not mention the obvious, the stove and the oven, which of course see a lot of use.

                    <h2>Coffee Maker</h2>
                    <p = coffee>Brings joy and purpose to my life at the start of the day. </p><p>
                        I try to fill it with water the night before in hopes that the chlorine will evaporate before brewing.
                        I always measure my coffee grounds by weight. 
                        Lately we've been using 5 grams per cup of coffee, which is about half of what Starbucks recommends. </p><p>
                        We are lucky because our oldest daughter works at Starbucks and she gets 1 free pound of coffee per week: enough for us, and extra to share with friends.

                    <h2>Air Fryer</h2>
                    <p = fryer>Providing variety to our dinners ever since we got one.</p><p>
                        We recently switched the basket one we had for this oven type one.
                        This one is fun because it has a rotisserie spit, and a basket that rotates, which basically 'shakes' your food for you. Yes, imagine French Fries.
                        One of my favorite recipes is this Air Fried Tofu.

                    <h2>Instant Pot</h2>
                    <p >This is by far the most practical and helpful appliance we have.
                        The number of fans of this electric pressure cooker keeps growing exponantially.
                        I have not talk to any IP owner who is not passionate about it and sharing their latest recipes.
                        In a nutshell: prepare a meal easily in one vesel. This appliance doubles as a pan and a programmable pressure cooker. It's easy to use, produces great food, and reduces the cleaning.
                        I think it's obvious I am in love with my IP.

                    <h2>Blender/Food Processor</h2>
                    <p = ninja>If you cook, you will want to blend foods at some point.
                        We don't use this enough to invest in a top of the line one, but we sure use it and are happy to have it.
                        Having the vase blender, the small cups, and then the processor bowls, allows us several applications from it, including, but not limited to, making pizza dough.

                    <h2>Rice Cooker</h2>
                    <p = rice> We use our rice cooker at least once a week. 
                        It makes it easy to make perfect rice with the push of a button.</p><p>
                        I have not experimented enough with it, but I can tell you it also makes good quinoa.
